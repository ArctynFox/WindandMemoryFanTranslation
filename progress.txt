	guide images (map of creeping field and beta map) untranslated currently


If there are issues, setting japanese to false at the end of the System.yaml file might be a fix, as I changed that to true

I have just discovered that the engine can only display up to 61 characters on one line properly, so I need to fit a *lot*
	61 characters is equivalent to the following:
		1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901
	that's why, I'm labeling all of the maps in the list above as fixed once I do a second run through them
	unfortunately, I may have to do a third pass as well though, considering how some dialogue can include a face image with it;
	can't be bothered to manually test everything so I'll fix whatever I miss as it gets reported
	* I tested some streaming dialogue in this map where, as opposed to the dialogue Toro and the mod creators use where they specify the character sprite/name and then give 1-4 lines of dialogue, I specify the character sprite/name and then just give all the dialogue they say.
		RPG Maker automatically separates dialogue lines into chunks of 4, so it was kind of pointless for them to do a lot of it the way they did (unless that's literally how RPG Maker auto-codes it but that's kinda weird if so considering this also works)
	update: new test has determined that dialogue with images is good up to exactly 50 characters on one line
	tl;dr:
		if there's a named character that should theoretically have a face image for their dialogue, limit each line to 50 chars
		else, limit to 61
		still need to fix map421 and CommonEvents
	update: I think I've fixed everything I've done previously, but players should watch for lines that extend off-screen and notify me if there are any

# Black Souls II Journey of Wind and Memory English Patch
I started translating this mod on a whim because I wanted to play it. I do not know Chinese, so there are almost certainly translation errors. Despite this, I've done what I can to remain faithful to the original creators' intent as well as make sure that information aligns with the lore of the original game. If you know Chinese and would like to correct anything, report anything that should be changed as an issue or create a pull request.

There have some known instances found through QA of crashing during specific dialogue. If you encounter any such issues, please [report it as an issue](https://github.com/ArctynFox/WindandMemoryFanTranslation/issues/new?assignees=ArctynFox&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D%2F%5BTRANSLATION%5D+%28only+keep+whichever+pertains+to+your+issue%29). Please be patient, and let me know of any of these issues that may arise. I am a one-person team and unfortunately do not have the resources to be perfect, especially when I translated all of this in less than 3 weeks.

# CONTENT WARNING
Black Souls II and consequently the Journey of Wind and Memory mod include sexual and violent content, as well as various content that could be traumatic. If you are under the age of 18, please turn back.

# Installation
Download the latest release and follow the readme found inside the zip. Alternatively, clone this repository and use Ruby with the RubyGem RVPacker (will require some modification as some features and packages are deprecated, see [rvpacker](https://github.com/Solistra/rvpacker) and its branches) to pack the game yourself and merge with BS2 files. While I include them in the latest releases, my repo does not include the necessary graphics and audio files, so if you want to build it yourself, please retrieve those from the original mod creators found in the Source.txt file. I also do not include any of the base game files that have not been modified, please purchase the game from Toro on dlsite to support the official release.

# Troubleshooting
First, please make sure you followed the installation instructions correctly.
If you still have issues, such as the game always crashing at at a specific location or during specific dialogue, please create an issue on this repo [here](https://github.com/ArctynFox/WindAndMemoryFanTranslation/issues/new/choose/). If you do this, please provide specific details on what you did leading up to the crash, or else I can't do much about it. It may also be helpful to provide your save file, as BS2 has a lot of progress flags that change interactions and how things behave.

I had never used RPG Maker before, and ended up doing the initial translation entirely in decompiled database code, then moved to the actual RPG Maker VX Ace editor later. This is part of the cause for the crashes mentioned above; I fix them as they are reported, so please let me know if one occurs.
